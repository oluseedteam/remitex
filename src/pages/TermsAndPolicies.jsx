                You acknowledge that maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials (including usernames, passwords, pins, or security tokens created or provided) is solely your responsibility, and you will be held accountable for any losses arising from the unauthorized use of your account.

                <p>
                In the event that your account details, password, or other security features are lost, stolen, used without authorization, or otherwise compromised, you are required to immediately change your password and contact Customer Support. The compromise of your account credentials could enable third parties to gain access to your account and initiate unauthorized transactions. To mitigate any potential losses, contacting Remitex promptly by email is the preferred course of action. You are further required to promptly notify us of any unrecognized activity in your transaction history. It is your responsibility to routinely monitor your account's transaction history and report any discrepancies or concerns without delay.
              <br />
              <br />
              Remitex reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to suspend your account or impose restrictions on its functionality if security concerns, potential unauthorized access, or suspected fraudulent activity arise.
              <br />
              <br />
              You must ensure that your email accounts are secure and accessible exclusively by you, as they may be used for password resets or other security-related communications concerning your Remitex account. Notify Customer Support immediately if your email account becomes compromised. You must refrain from using any functionality that allows login details or passwords to be stored, cached, or otherwise recorded by your computer, browser, or other devices. Additional security requirements may apply to other Remitex products or services you may use, and you are responsible for adhering to these requirements as communicated

                <p>You can add funds to your Balance using an authorized payment account. By initiating a transfer, you authorize Remitex to access and process your payment information. The Services enable you to send transfers to designated recipients. Remitex will undertake the processing and transmission of the transfer based on your provided instructions. We may establish limitations on the value or frequency of transfers. It is your responsibility to ensure the accuracy of the recipient's information. Once you have confirmed a transfer, it is considered final and cannot be reversed by you Remitex equips you with tools to review and verify your transfer before confirming it, thereby assisting in identifying any potential mistyped transfers. However, any losses arising from mistyped or incorrect recipient information shall be your sole responsibility. Remitex shall not be held liable for any losses resulting from inaccurately entered or mistyped recipient information for transfers. We reserve the right to, at our absolute discretion, attempt to reverse your instruction if you have communicated your desire for us to do so. Should a reversal be possible, a fee of 3 CAD will apply for CAD transactions, 10 USD for USD and an applicable fee not more than 10 USD for other currency transactions.

                <h4>5.1 Nature of Your Remitex account</h4>

                
                <p>
                Remitex is not a bank, and your Remitex account is not a bank account. The bank account details provided to you for receiving funds from third parties are associated with accounts held by Remitex and its affiliates. Upon receipt of funds into these accounts, Remitex will credit the corresponding amount to your Remitex account balance. However, the bank account holding these funds is not owned by you. The balance in your CadRemit account represents an unsecured claim against Remitex and is not insured by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) or any similar deposit protection scheme.
              <br />
              <br />
              Remitex manages customer balances in compliance with applicable money transmitter laws. The funds in customer balances are not used for operational expenses or other corporate purposes and will not be made available to creditors in the event of Remitex’s bankruptcy.
              <br />
              <br />
              The value held in your Remitex account remains an unsecured claim against Remitex and is not protected by any deposit insurance scheme, including the CDIC.

                <p>
                The USD virtual account and transfer services offered by Remitex are powered by Bridge, a third-party provider. By accessing and using these services, you agree to comply with the terms, conditions, and privacy policy set forth by Bridge, which are available here, as well as Remitex own Terms. Engaging in USD services signifies acceptance of both Bridge and Remitex applicable policies.

                <p>
                You agree to use the Services in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including those related to anti-money laundering (AML), fraud prevention, and the funding of illegal activities. Remitex may perform identity verification checks and monitor transactions for suspicious activity.
                You are strictly prohibited from using the Services provided by Remitex for any illegal activities, including but not limited to money laundering, fraud, and funding of terrorist organizations.

              <br />
              <br />
              If it becomes necessary for Remitex to block transfers associated with your account due to government sanctions programs or to comply with lawful requests and or compliance with anti-money laundering programs, we reserve the right to deactivate your account or suspend a pending transfer.
              <br />
              <br />
              Remitex shall not be held accountable for any losses, whether direct or indirect, that you may experience as a result of our compliance with applicable laws, guidance, or directions from regulatory authorities or government agencies, or any legal orders such as writs of attachment, liens, levies, subpoenas, warrants, or other legal orders.
